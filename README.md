# Pressure-Sensing
This code creates a dynamic visual representation of sensor data using p5.js and the Web Serial library. It reads input from a pressure sensor connected to a microcontroller and uses the data to generate a circle at the center of the canvas, with its size and color changing based on the sensor readings.
